# 🎮 ESP32-S3 Native USB HID Gamepad Emulator

Turn your **ESP32-S3** into a fully functional **USB HID gamepad** that Windows automatically recognizes as a standard game controller. Development requires ESP-IDF v5.5.4, but no additional Windows drivers are needed.

Built with **ESP-IDF** and **TinyUSB**, this project provides a lightweight, low-latency USB HID implementation that's perfect for custom controllers, simulator hardware, robotics, and other embedded projects.

Originally created for DIY button boxes used in **Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2)**, **American Truck Simulator (ATS)**, and racing simulators, the firmware can easily be customized for almost any USB HID controller.

> **This project isn't limited to button boxes.** It can be adapted for custom gamepads, arcade controllers, flight simulator panels, stream decks, macro pads, control panels, and much more.

# ⚠️ Before You Install

Before building or flashing the firmware, make sure the following requirements are met:

* Install **ESP-IDF v5.5.4**. This version has been tested and is known to work.
* Your board has both a **Native USB (USB-OTG)** port and a **USB-to-UART** port.
* The **USB-OTG pads** on the back of the board are bridged. While this may not be required on every board, all successful testing has been performed with the pads connected.
* Flash the firmware using the **USB-to-UART** port.
* After flashing, reconnect the USB cable to the **Native USB (USB-OTG)** port.

If these steps are not followed, Windows may not detect the controller correctly.

# 🚀 Installation

New to ESP32 development?

Follow the complete setup guide here:

**🎥 YouTube:** *(Insert Video Link Here)*

## 1. Install ESP-IDF

Install **ESP-IDF v5.5.4** from the official Espressif documentation.

> 📎 **ESP-IDF Installation Guide:** *([Insert Link Here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.4/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation))*

## 2. Clone the repository

Download the latest release and unzip it. Then move the **tusb_hid** file into your project

---

## 3. Open terminal

In the windows search bar search **ESP IDF** and open

---

## 4. Cd into the project workspace

```bash
cd DRIVE\Folder\Folder\Project\tusb_hid
```
---

## 5. Build the Project

```bash
idf.py build
```

---

## 6. Flash the Firmware

Connect your board using the **UART** port and run:

```bash
idf.py flash
```

---

## 5. Connect as a Gamepad

After flashing:

1. Disconnect the USB cable.
2. Connect it to the **Native USB (USB-OTG)** port.
3. Windows should automatically detect the device as a USB HID Gamepad.
4. Verify operation by opening **Set up USB Game Controllers** (`joy.cpl`).

# 🔌 Wiring

Connect each button between **3.3V** and the configured GPIO pin.

```text
      3.3V
        │
    ┌───┴────┐
    │ Button │
    └───┬────┘
        │
GPIO (Example: GPIO4)
```

The firmware uses the ESP32-S3's **internal pull-down resistors**, meaning every GPIO remains **LOW** until the button is pressed, at which point it reads **HIGH**.
